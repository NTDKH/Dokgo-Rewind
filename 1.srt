00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.910
I don't think I can go to
school for some time.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.980
If I go, they'll step all over me.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.740
Are you dumb?

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.260
You think we're any better
than those guys?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.810
- No, it's not that.
- Go.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.000
- Hey, Hyuk.
- My sister!

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.300
I want to protect my sister.
That's why.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.600
So...

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.710
did you guys eat?

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.510
You ate pork belly 30 minutes ago.
How can you eat more?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:04.100
I digested everything during the fight.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.270
I'd rather raise a cow than this bastard.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.600
Oh, my...

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.230
Drink my water.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.630
You're a good bastard.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.250
Wait a minute. Let me see.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.850
What, what, what? What is it?

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.000
Whoa! Hey, look.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.100
She's pretty. Look.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.670
Is this your sister?

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.110
Yeah. Right. Why?

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.740
You're sharing your food?

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.820
Brother-in-law!

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.370
You want to protect your sister?

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.050
Don't worry, brother-in-law.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.420
Why? Because I can
protect her, okay?

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.780
Brother-in-law.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.030
Tell us the rest of the story
while we're at it.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.860
What happened to your sister?

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.190
So...

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.960
my sister Hyun Sun started
attending our school.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.860
But Shin Soo Jung...

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.380
was in my sister's class.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.190
Shin Soo Jung is the girlfriend
of the 11th grader leader, Joo Sung.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.190
[ Kim Hyun Sun ]

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.330
I get the picture.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.410
Joo Sung was interested
in your sister

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.060
and Shin Soo Jung got crazy jealous.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.860
So she scared her, right?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.900
Not just scaring her, but...

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.450
Hey,

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.490
Did you flirt with Joo Sung?

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.540
How dare you get greedy?

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.860
Hey.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.200
Move over.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.330
Hey.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.560
Are you that pretty, b****?

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.290
You think you're pretty, too, right?

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.440
If I ever see your face again...

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.080
you're dead.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.500
Got it? Dang it!

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.550
Stay still.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.920
Make her drink it.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.280
Open...

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.400
Drink it.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.000
Hyun Sun.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.910
Tell your mom and pop...

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.450
that you mistook it as a beverage.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.850
Got it?

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.830
Make her drink it.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.210
Bunch of SOBs!

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.820
But why is Joo Sung bugging you?

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.670
Shin Soo Jung's cousin
Shin Do Yoon

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.720
also attends our school.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.550
He's a senior.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.080
He's one of the leaders in the group.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.630
Hey,

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.300
you cheated on Soo Jung, huh?

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.620
No, it's...

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.700
- You're crazy, right?
- No.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.320
Her brother also attends
our school, huh?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.480
Yes.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.030
Squash him.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.610
- Excuse me?
- Beat him half to death.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.940
Don't you understand?

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.650
- Huh?
- Yes, I got it.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.600
The answer is simple.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.410
Wipe out the punks at
Dang Young High, right?

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.870
Aigoo, it's not as simple as you think.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.250
Because I got punched
a few times earlier?

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.000
That was because
he was playing dirty!

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.480
If we really fight, I'd win!

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.400
Dang Young High is one thing, but
Gi Cheon and Dang Young are allies.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.900
Allies... so what?
What does that mean?

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.300
Am I the only one who doesn't know?

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.530
Anyways, Gi Cheon High
has Jo Gang Hoon.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.160
He's the top in this area.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.090
Let's keep it simple.
You and I, one to one.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.130
[ Jo Gang Hoon ]

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.290
What do you think?

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.400
Are you sure?

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.400
- Hey, Yang Tae!
- Yeah.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.050
Hey!

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.810
You're not all that as
I thought. You okay?

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.210
Huh?

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.720
He has never lost a fight.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.280
Where's your house?

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.100
I have to take a shuttle
across the street.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.920
Go straight home.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.350
Don't roam around and get
caught by those punks.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.040
But...

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.210
the thing you said before...

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.120
The fact that you'd help me...

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.550
Come to the same spot
tomorrow night.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.220
Thank you.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.630
Thank you so much.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.420
I'll leave now.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.170
Bye.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.640
Let's go, too.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.640
At night?

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.320
I'll be late tomorrow.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.680
I have plans with my family.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.600
Hey, you can cancel
with your family.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.420
I want to but...

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.390
- my hyung will nag.
- You have a hyung?

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.410
I'm leaving. See you tomorrow.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.150
Bye.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.740
Someone actually nags Hyuk?

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.310
Hey, if it's Hyuk's hyung, he must be
an awesome fighter, huh?

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.620
You're home.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.540
You were at school all day,
and you still want to study?

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.790
It's something I like to do.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.710
You have to prepare, too.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.370
You were a great student in school.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.120
You're nagging as soon
as you see me?

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.720
Is school okay for you?

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.670
You know how it is.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.220
Of course,

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.550
you are the top student in school.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.260
It has to be great.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.800
Hurry and come back, too.
Or take the GED...

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.630
Hey. Forget it.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.550
Is there anyone bothering you?

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.760
Huh?

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.080
If there is, just tell me.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.790
I don't have anyone like that.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.350
That's good then.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.840
You know we are taking a family
portrait tomorrow night, right?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.750
- Don't go anywhere tomorrow...
- I know, I remember.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.840
Okay, go to sleep.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.550
Dang, this hurts a lot.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.490
What should we do?

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.810
What do you mean?

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:03.120
Joo Sung, that psycho, will take all
our money as soon as he sees us.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.700
Why is that bastard making us
clean up his mess?

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.390
He should clean up his own mess.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.830
Let's stop doing this.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.400
You crazy bastard.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.100
How can we do that?

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.520
Just shut up and follow
my lead, you bastard.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.910
Yesterday, you...

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.230
said with your own mouth,

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.830
that you got him, didn't you?

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.730
Yes.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.710
Then where is Kim Kyu Soon?

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.240
And what happened to your faces?

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.950
I'm sorry.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.340
I'm sorry.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.500
Did you get beat up by Kim Kyu Soon?

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.260
- It's not that.
- If not, then what?

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.850
We were planning to
return right away,

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.020
but some punks suddenly appeared,

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.740
beat us up and took Kim Kyu Soon.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.890
Some punks?

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.040
We wanted to fight them,
but it was difficult.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.960
They seemed older than us and

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.560
those thugs weren't
even attending schools.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.850
Why would those thugs
help Kim Kyu Soon?

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.230
I'm not sure.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.590
Seemed like they were
getting paid to protect him.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.000
- Hey, is that true?
- Huh?

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.830
Yes.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.220
How many were there?

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.130
Let's see...

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.070
two...

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.650
Seemed like more than 10.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.300
Dang... It's so complicated.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.600
Okay, you can leave.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.780
Why did you lie like that?

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.090
We'd get our a** kicked
if he finds out.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.730
That won't happen, you stupid.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.690
Didn't you see him get scared
when I said more than 10?

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.420
Greet me properly, you bastard!

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.240
Same position. Same position!

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.390
Are you playing with me?

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.090
Why is it taking you
so long to get an idiot?

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.410
It's because...

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.730
the neighborhood thugs are interfering
and I can't handle it on my own.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.120
So frustrating...

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.940
So...

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.570
I just need to get rid
of the thugs, right?

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.160
Yes, but...

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.890
What?

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.590
I thought you didn't have any
power to gather everyone.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.640
So, so what?

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.580
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.170
No.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.430
We're not the only group, you know.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.390
What's up?

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.260
You can gather guys without
Gang Hoon's approval, right?

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.500
Yeah, except for the seniors.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.830
But why?

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.930
I need to ask you a favor.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.780
I'll make it worth it.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.010
Our guys are expensive.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.170
I'll treat you later.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.950
So tell me.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.230
- Did you call us, Sunbaenim?
- Hi.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.380
Gather all the 10th and 11th
graders by tomorrow.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.910
We have a job to do.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.340
Yes.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.940
But...

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.390
Sunbae?

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.440
What?

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.170
Should I call Jin Hwan hyung, too?

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:54.670
No, not him.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.530
Not big enough for him
to be involved.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:00.610
Besides, that bastard
won't listen to me.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.110
Got it.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.530
Okay, ready.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.210
One, two, three.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.590
Yes, good job. Give me a minute.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.600
Hyuk!

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.510
Should we go out to eat
since we're all together?

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.370
I have plans already.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.800
Hyuk, don't be like that.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.270
I'll be home before midnight.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.590
When will he come to his senses?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.070
You want to get it from me!

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.300
Cut, cut, cut. Brother-in-law.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.900
Brother-in-law, what's with
"You want to get it from me?"

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.600
You want to get it from me?

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.220
Listen to this.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.790
When you fight,

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.240
whoever dominates first has
a 90% chance of winning.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.980
So how do you do that?

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.880
You want to die?

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.670
I'll rip your mouth apart!

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.360
If you say something like this,

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.970
it's better than
"You want to get it from me?"

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.350
Here, let's try again.
I'm coming in, okay?

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.170
You want to die?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.650
It's better than I thought.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.090
You have talent.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.300
But, brother-in-law.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.110
When can we meet...

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.070
Hyun Sun?

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.440
I'm going to the hospital tomorrow.
Want to come with me?

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.870
It's been a while since she
met friends, so she'll be happy.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.690
Great!

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.560
Okay, let's start from one, two again.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.970
One, two!

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:36.660
One, two!

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.260
Take it easy, man.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.080
Then let's fight.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.200
Dang. Why do you come all
the way here to steal money?

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.540
I really don't understand.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.010
It's quiet and nice here.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.560
Hey, you!

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.070
Get lost!

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.100
- Those bastards.
- What is that?

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.900
Hey, don't butt in
and just leave, okay?

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:10.140
Hey!

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.770
If you're able, please help me, huh?

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.050
I'm in the wrestling team, so
I'm not supposed to fistfight.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.820
Why don't you shut up!

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.460
I said to stop. You'll get hurt!

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.780
Hey, wrestler. Will you buy us
food if we help you?

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.280
I'll buy you meat, too.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.020
Yes! Hey, meat, meat!

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.460
Aigoo, bastard...

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.180
Let's help him.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.290
Hey, you stay there.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.700
Brother-in-law, watch carefully, okay?

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.650
Come here.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.480
Stay there.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.100
I didn't do anything, okay?

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.460
Why would they bother a wrestler?

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.510
They're from my school.
They know I'm on the team.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.740
But today, I don't have any money left
after buying this for my sunbae.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.040
Why coffee out of the blue?

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.680
- Are you sure about that?
- Huh?

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.400
What about?

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.760
No, nothing.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.610
Seems like you're the leader.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.420
You didn't even fight.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.160
I'm a friend.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.780
Yeah, right. Wrestler, you
have to buy us meat.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.250
I really don't have any money today,

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.770
I'll buy after my training is over.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.100
- Just come here, right?
- When?

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.500
Hey, tell us exactly the date and time.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.110
Man, that's enough, Parasite.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.000
Anyway, thanks!

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.300
I'm Pyo Tae Jin.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.700
I'm Kang Hyuk.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.030
I'm Gu Bon Hwan.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.600
I'm Jae Wook.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.700
I'm Kim...

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.030
She came again.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.000
Excuse me.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.770
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.310
I'm not a weird guy, okay?

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.900
Wait. This!

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.180
Hey!

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.200
What the heck?

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.500
[ Pyo Tae Jin ]

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.280
- I'm back.
- Yeah?

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:27.950
I just heard a woman
screaming. Didn't you?

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.540
I'm not sure.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.180
I didn't hear anything.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.650
Was I wrong?

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.510
Did you buy what I asked for?

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.510
Yes.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.940
Hey, you really!
If you weren't the ace...

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.320
Why are you hitting me?

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.370
You be quiet!

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.000
Maxim!

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.640
This is Maxim!

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.980
What? Are you a
pervert or something?

00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.840
Page 72.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.150
Man, why isn't that Parasite here yet?

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.080
He acted as if he'd be
the first one here.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.460
He'll be here.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.570
What the heck is wrong with him?

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.030
Sorry.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.810
I'm a little late.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.020
I had a lot to prepare.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.410
Let's go up.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.100
Kyu Soon must be waiting.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.180
What about Dad?

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.550
You know that he's really busy.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.020
He's really worried about us

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.200
over in the US.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.840
Because of us...

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.720
He worries about you a lot, too.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.490
Hyun Sun.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.420
Even though it's tough,

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.980
let's get through this, okay?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.800
Oppa is right here.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.750
Who is it?

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.300
Hi, Kyu Soon.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.630
- Who are...
- It's okay, Hyun Sun.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.100
These are my friends.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.340
It's okay. You're okay.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:32.130
Ever since that incident, she gets
anxious around strangers.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.420
Please understand.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.310
Hyun Sun.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:38.670
This is Bon Hwan oppa.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:39.930
He's really fun.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.930
Hello, Hyun Sun. I'm your new Oppa.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.130
And this is Jae Wook Oppa.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:45.910
Hi, Hyun Sun.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.310
Isn't he cool?

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:50.130
This is Hyuk...

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.700
A gift.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.000
So cool.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.300
They're all nice oppas.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.400
Jong Il, is something wrong?

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.100
I really don't like this.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.900
What?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.100
Just all of this.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.100
This is nothing but what thugs do.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.060
What can we do when
sunbaes order us?

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.650
I'll do everything,
so you just stay here.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.650
I don't know.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.500
I just don't like this.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.160
Hey, Kim Jong Il.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.920
What will do you about it?

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.310
Huh?

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.870
If you don't like it, go above sunbae

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.750
and say, "I don't want to do this."

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.720
Do that then.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.730
You act like you're the leader here.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.300
- We were just talking...
- Don't touch me, you bastard.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.150
Because you always protect him,

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.960
he doesn't know his place
and is getting out of line.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.090
Wake up, you bastard.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:20.800
You're the lowest in rank here.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.400
Well...

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.280
you have to abide by order of ranks.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.190
Jong Il,

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:28.890
you don't like it?

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:31.520
- I'm asking if you don't like this.
- No, stop.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.830
I'm watching you.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:45.940
Wow...

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
A gift.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.440
You're so cool.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.180
I'm baffled.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.380
Hyun Sun only greeted Hyuk.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.530
My pride hurts.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.740
She didn't even look at me.
Let's stop it here.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.890
What do you mean stop?

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.200
Aren't they the ones?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.100
She's so pretty.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.570
They are.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.740
Who the heck are they?

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.020
There are only three?

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.140
They said there are more than 10.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.230
They probably don't roam
around with them.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.350
You're Kim Kyu Soon, right?

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.890
We have some business
with that punk.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:28.730
You won't hand him over, will you?

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.240
You got that right.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.780
It's not too late.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.230
If you hand him over,
nothing will happen.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.900
You're so kind.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.440
- Hey, you want a suggestion?
- What?

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.200
If you disappear right now,
nothing will happen.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.290
- Let's start.
- Yeah, let's start. Come here.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.440
Are you a middle schooler?

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.540
Yeah, you are!

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.840
Come here.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.680
It's not over yet.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.800
No more.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.240
I'll take it from here.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.510
I'm still okay.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.470
I'll take care of it so
don't do anything.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.220
It's not okay with me.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.180
We're switching players.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.330
No complaints, huh?

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:06.790
As you wish.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:09.200
What will you do?

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.080
That's okay. Don't worry.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.000
Hyuk will end it right away.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.110
Did you hear about the fight
to decide the ranks tomorrow?

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.030
I'm listening right now.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.790
What will you do?

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:30.620
Hey.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.700
We agreed to stay low in high school.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:37.770
If we're on the bottom, they'll step
all over us for three years.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.080
I'm really not interested,
so you fight if you want to.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.700
I'll say this one last time.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.200
Just hand him over.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.650
Then we'll leave right away.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.300
Do you sell out your friend?

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.850
That's right.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.470
I would've said the same
thing in your shoes.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.400
What is that?

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:47.450
What's that?

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.960
What?

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.880
Hey, where are you going?

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.930
You're all scared.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:57.520
Don't ever come back!

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.660
Hey, say bye.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.090
Hey, it's the police. Let's run.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.740
Why are we running?

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.030
Even if we didn't do anything,
they'll hassle us. Hurry.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.330
Hey, run, run, run!

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.410
Run! Run!

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.050
Hey, they're not chasing us, right?

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.700
- They're not chasing us, right?
- Yeah, we lost them.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.500
Anyway, what was the deal
with that short dude?

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.280
He's the first one to fight
Hyuk like that, right?

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.860
- I'm sorry.
- Huh?

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.140
What for?

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.290
This is all because of me.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.410
But there was nothing I could do.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.990
I was wondering what you were saying.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.530
Hey, don't worry about
things like that, okay?

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:21.050
It's a sign.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.800
- A sign.
- Huh?

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.700
The ones bothering you and your
sister should be sorry. Not you.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.510
Don't worry about it.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.240
Thank you.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.990
I really thank you.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:36.920
And despite that,
if you want to treat us

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.720
you can buy us some meat.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.180
Please, stop talking
about eating, okay?

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.700
Okay! Let's go and eat.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.500
You don't have to
spend money on us.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.990
No.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:50.890
I'm not being mugged.
I'm treating my friends.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:52.520
Okay!

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.340
See? See?

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.840

[ Gi Cheon High School ]

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.620
Kim Jong Il, step forward.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.300
- Say what you want to say.
- I'm sorry.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.710
Hey, hey.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.330
What are you doing?

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.300
Jong Il must be hurting.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.690
If you wanted to hide your skills,
you should've done a better job.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.760
Why did you show off
and get beat up? Huh?

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.000
I want to knife you all over.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.000
Aigoo, see how he stares.

You think you're a sunbae to me, huh?

Man, this bastard is annoying me.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:10.540

Yes.

Why did you do that?

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.370
I'm sorry.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.970
I wanted to stay low.

Then, you should've never joined.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.640
Was anyone forced
to join our group?

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.780
No, there aren't!

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.250
I'll say this again.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.380

to join us or not.

Yes.

There is nothing I can do
if that's what you want.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:50.030
Just promise me one thing.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.340
The moment you leave,

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.060

If you don't keep that promise,

you'll pay the consequences.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:01.690
That will...

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.380
Huh?

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.830
Shouldn't you take the
injured guys out to eat?

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.900
I was wondering what
you were talking about.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.360
Fine. Money is not an issue for us.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.500
I'll take care...

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:51.160
Where is Shin Do Yoon?

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:58.060
♫ You were there in those times ♫

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:05.040
♫ We'll go through it together  ♫

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.610
♫ I can have a new dream of my life ♫

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:13.180
♫ For the first time, first time, yeah ♫

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:17.070
♫ I can't do this alone, come on ♫
