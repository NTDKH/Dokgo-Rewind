00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,680
Hey, Pyo Tae Jin.

4
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,960
Huh?

5
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,910
Ah, man...

6
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,440
Practice is over anyway
so go out for a bit.

7
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,850
Yes.

8
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,200
Hello.

9
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,030
Can't you just spend the
day with me tomorrow?

10
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,930
No, I can't.

11
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,710
It's not because I don't like you, but...

12
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,150
You know I'm attending training camp.

13
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,810
- Then we can hang out on your days off, right?
- Yes.

14
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,950
Excuse me?

15
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,290
I know your training schedule.

16
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,650
I know when you have your day off...

17
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,900
I know...

18
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,270
Ah, that changed...

19
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,590
What, what?

20
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,810
You said you can't spend time
with me because of training.

21
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,610
Okay, okay.

22
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,410
Okay, let's hang out.

23
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,570
Promise.

24
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,700
We have to stamp it and sign it.

25
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,300
And copy it.

26
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,140
This is so childish.

27
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,500
Hey.

28
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,310
Did you see the guys who
always hang out here?

29
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,160
Why should I?

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,350
Geez...

31
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,030
So small, but vicious.

32
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,590
Alright.

33
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,360
They told me to buy them food.
Where did they go?

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,760
Hey.

35
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,820
What did you just say?

36
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,000
Me?

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
About being small?

38
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,920
Sorry.

39
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,360
Do you want to die?

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,280
No.

41
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,150
Man.

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,600
I'm not allowed to fight, so go
find someone else, okay?

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,750
Man... really.

44
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,120
Sorry, okay?

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,260
I'll leave so let's stop here.

46
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,350
I'm boiling up inside...

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,900
but no one to take it out on.

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,400
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,530
But I can't help it either.

50
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,620
Hey, wrestling!

51
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,620
What are you doing here?

52
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,990
Where were you guys?

53
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,190
Dang, this little twerp.

54
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,750
Who told you to look away?

55
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,660
Do that one more time here.

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
And you're dead.

57
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,130
I did it. What will you do now?

58
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,060
Okay, you two can fight.
I'm leaving.

59
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,440
Where are you going?

60
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,930
This isn't over yet.

61
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,460
Like I said, I have no
desire to fight you.

62
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,540
Showing off with wrestling, huh?

63
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm warning you.
Don't trash talk wrestling.

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,490
Who watches wrestling these days?

65
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,260
- I said to stop now.
- Can you make a living after graduating?

66
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,770
All you can become is
a gangster, isn't it?

67
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,070
Really...

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
What is this?

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,070
Stop now.

70
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,530
That's good.

71
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,870
Both of you, fight me.

72
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,830
Wow, this is really fun.

73
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,590
Won't be so easy for Hyuk this time.

74
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,820
But why are they fighting?

75
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,550
I don't know.

76
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,540
There's really no reason...

77
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,880
Who knew Hyuk would be
dumber than us?

78
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,450
I don't think that's the case.

79
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,340
Right? I regretted it as
soon as I said it.

80
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,850
Hey, the small one is feisty.

81
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,560
But Hyuk is still better.

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
The big oppa seems to
be stronger though.

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,600
Yeah.

84
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,590
What the heck are they doing?

85
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,300
That just looks bad.

86
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,520
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Let go.

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
At the count of three,
we let go at once.

88
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,000
One, two, three!

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,100
Hey, we said we'll let go!

90
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,300
Why didn't you let go?

91
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,820
Ow, I almost let go.

92
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,650
- Hey.
- Hey.

93
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,780
Hey, let go. Let go!

94
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,300
Let go!

95
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,740
You're strong like an ox.

96
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,890
Hey.

97
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,650
If I hadn't held back from the get-go,
this would've been over fast.

98
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,870
Can't you see this?

99
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,740
If these weren't empty,
you'd all be dead by now.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
Don't you have anything to say?

101
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,010
I can't break their bones.

102
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,200
- You're all talk.
- What?

103
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,150
So funny.

104
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,940
My stomach hurts.

105
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,980
Thanks...

106
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,240
for making Hyun Sun laugh like that.

107
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,760
Anyway...

108
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,310
how's school these days?

109
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,630
Not sure...

110
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,270
I'm training every day, so I don't know.

111
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,700
That's right.

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,300
I heard someone in my grade
died in an accident.

113
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,790
An accident?

114
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,550
We received a notification from school.

115
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,260
I didn't read it.

116
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,900
Do I still have it?

117
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,670
Here it is.

118
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,550
What's wrong?

119
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,410
Hyun Sun.

120
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,580
Leave.

121
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,700
It's late, so go home.

122
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,820
What do you mean?
We can take her home later.

123
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,260
We need to...

124
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,830
talk in private.

125
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,230
Hey, what's wrong with you?

126
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,060
It's ok, I was going to leave anyway.

127
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,820
Then I'll take you home.

128
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,140
No, I'm okay.

129
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,870
- But still...
- Hey...

130
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,150
I can see her to the bus station.

131
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,950
I have to go back, too.

132
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,710
Okay, please take care of her.

133
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,040
Hyun Sun, see you tomorrow!

134
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,090
Hyuk, what's wrong?

135
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,390
Can't Hyun Sun listen
to our conversation?

136
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,530
- D*** it!
- What is it?

137
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,440
You said we should
leave it to the adults.

138
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,720
Let's beat up those
Dang Young High thugs.

139
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,260
Will you attack Dang Young High?

140
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,140
Then help me.

141
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,310
What?

142
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,410
I'm going to attack Gi Cheon High.

143
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,200
Look at your school uniform.
How can we trust you?

144
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,460
Gi Cheon and Dang Young are allies.

145
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,020
How can we trust you?
Will you buy us a meal?

146
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,420
Really?

147
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,560
The thugs at Gi Cheon got me suspended
and sent my friend to the hospital.

148
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,240
- If you don't believe me, go and check.
- It's okay.

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,210
If he were on Gi Cheon's side,

150
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,290
he would've already attacked us.

151
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,810
That's true.

152
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,940
If we want to attack Dang Young,

153
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,630
we'll have to face Gi Cheon, too.

154
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,090
It'd be good to help each other.

155
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,570
Do you have a plan?

156
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,920
What plan? We'll just go
beat them all up right now.

157
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,550
That'd be 60 guys from Dang Young
and 40 from Gi Cheon.

158
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,080
Each school has about 10 top fighters.

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,630
So from both schools, about 20

160
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,880
are able to fight seven to
eight by themselves.

161
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,240
The key members from the alliance,
Kim Myung Hak, Myung Jin Hwan,

162
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,920
Kim Jung Min, are fighters
we might not be able to beat.

163
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,260
And...

164
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,200
lastly, Jo Gang Hoon.

165
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,650
Jo Gang Hoon...

166
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,510
He is definitely stronger than us.

167
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,580
I hear about him often these days.

168
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,170
So to fight them without a plan

169
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,460
is just plain suicide.

170
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,800
Then what is your strategy?

171
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,350
You don't have any plans either, right?

172
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,820
I thought you had a plan when
you shared that information.

173
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,990
Sorry.

174
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,010
There's someone I need to meet.

175
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,970
Hey, hey, it's Jo Gang Hoon.

176
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,970
Yeah, Gang Hoon.

177
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,780
We're doing our best.

178
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,590
We're trying our very best, give us...

179
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,530
Look at his manner...

180
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,130
I didn't even finish saying...

181
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,950
Isn't there a bastard who can
take on Jo Gang Hoon?

182
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,610
Yeah, Gang Hoon. Do you have
anything else to say?

183
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,180
Sunbaenim, it's me.

184
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,060
- Yeah, what?
- Well...

185
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,590
Someone's here to see you.

186
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,530
- Who is it?
- I don't know, but he's not here to beat us up.

187
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,130
What?

188
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,360
Lee Dong Jae?

189
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,100
Who the heck are you?

190
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,590
We want to attack
Gi Chun and Dang Young.

191
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,220
I'm not in a good mood today.

192
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,620
I don't have time to deal
with crazy bastards...

193
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,780
I got hurt here. Wait a minute.

194
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,200
Whoa...

195
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,500
You're really cowardly.

196
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,820
Why don't you just listen to us first?

197
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,930
Listen to what?

198
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,240
I heard that you have
to pay the alliance.

199
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,520
Wouldn't you like it if
they're destroyed?

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,100
Dong Jae, what are you doing?

201
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,340
Are we best friends?

202
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,620
Stop calling my name like that, okay?

203
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,330
Kill them.

204
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,220
About eight. Do you want to bet?

205
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,330
So cowardly.

206
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,610
Should we talk now?

207
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,500
Your sugar level must've dropped
from fighting. Drink this.

208
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,030
Drink, drink.

209
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,430
So you're the one who recently turned
Gi Cheon High upside down.

210
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,810
Do you know me?

211
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm the antenna in the area.
There isn't anything I don't know.

212
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,940
How did you know to come see me?

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,500
Park Hyung Kook told me about you.

214
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,300
So you're the one who
beat up Hyung Kook, huh?

215
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,900
You should've told me
stuff like that sooner.

216
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,460
Our guys didn't have to get hurt.

217
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,000
You're more servile than I thought.

218
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,080
So you want to destroy the alliance
between Gi Cheon and Dang Young?

219
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,640
Just the two of you?

220
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,330
We have two more.

221
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,560
Total of four?

222
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,900
It'll be hard to face them head-on.

223
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,080
But it may be possible to
attack them from the side.

224
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,200
If you want to break
down the alliance,

225
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,570
you just need to attack Gi Cheon.

226
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,190
Then Dang Young High

227
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,770
will be like an airplane without wings?

228
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,930
Kimbap without rice?

229
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,470
Hoodie without a hood.

230
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,290
I'm so good at explaining.

231
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,740
So I saw your skills.

232
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,870
The 10th and 11th graders at Gi Cheon
will not be a problem for you.

233
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,340
The problem will be the seniors.

234
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,390
As you know,

235
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,530
the ones coming to school are
Jo Gang Hoon, Kim Myung Hak,

236
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,540
and also Myung Jin Hwan.

237
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,380
The rest of them are either in
performing arts or skipping school.

238
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,070
Simply put, they're not in the circle.

239
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,430
What did I say before?

240
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,440
I'm an antenna in this area.

241
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,010
North, south, east, and west.
Wherever they may be,

242
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,710
they're all within my radar.

243
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,980
So...

244
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,390
are you listening?

245
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,900
Continue...

246
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,650
Bring them out one by one...

247
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,690
and fight them.
Then you have a chance.

248
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,400
But as I mentioned earlier...

249
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,020
Jo Gang Hoon...

250
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,760
He's not human.

251
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
He'll be difficult.

252
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,900
We'll think about that later.

253
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,860
We got it so arrange it for us.

254
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,150
I think it'll be difficult for
me to arrange it for you.

255
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,630
But I'll let you know.

256
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,100
Okay, Dong Jae.

257
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,740
But you know...

258
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm curious. Are you two friends?

259
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,610
Why?

260
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,330
What do you mean why?

261
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,740
I'm a senior. I'm a year older than you.

262
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,480
You have to call me hyung.

263
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,160
Goodbye, Dong Jae.

264
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,810
I'm also leaving, Dong Jae.

265
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,610
You'll have to deal with some
since they know who I am.

266
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,010
But I have to take care of the last two.

267
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,190
Who?

268
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,050
Jo Gang Hoon...

269
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,640
and Myung Jin Hwan.

270
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,990
Alright.

271
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,110
Yoon Ho Sung, 12th grader, 7th in rank.

272
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,960
He was making everyone miserable.

273
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,900
A kid got aphasia because
of him. Such a scumbag.

274
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,330
Gwak Sung Gil, 6th in rank.

275
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,410
He's the dregs of humanity.

276
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,530
He even takes money from
elementary students.

277
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,200
He's the worst dirtbag.

278
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,000
Go.

279
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,240
5th in rank, Song Young Chul.

280
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,220
He's a boxer so you have to be careful.

281
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,840
He hits guys like they're punching bags.

282
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,080
4th in rank, Choi Kyung Ahn.

283
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,440
He goes clubbing every day to get girls.

284
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,300
3rd in rank, Mo Gwang Sung.

285
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,580
Trash of the universe, so
beat him up as you wish.

286
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,300
S***.

287
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,030
Hey, you're pretty.

288
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,030
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

289
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,670
Huh?

290
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,700
Why are you doing this?

291
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,200
What's wrong? Am I a thug
or something?

292
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,880
Don't... don't do this...

293
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,050
Hey, Sung Kyu, go easy.
People are watching.

294
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,320
Go easy.

295
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,590
Hey!

296
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,580
Stop.

297
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,590
Aren't you the wrestler in 11th grade?

298
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,840
Yeah.

299
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,330
So what?

300
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,970
So what?

301
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,750
An 11th grader talks
like that to a senior?

302
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,690
Wow...

303
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,560
I should just kill you.

304
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,810
Sung Kyu.

305
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,380
Sung Kyu.

306
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,980
Hey!

307
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,930
Isn't there seniority in wrestling?

308
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,770
Look down, you bastard.

309
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,600
Look at this a**hole...

310
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,000
Let go.

311
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,800
Won't you let go? Ow!

312
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,100
Are you crazy?

313
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,280
Hey! Dang Young High!

314
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,980
What are you doing?

315
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,660
Don't cause trouble, okay?

316
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,350
It's your lucky day, bastard.

317
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,550
I should dissolve the wrestling team.

318
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,930
Are you okay?

319
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,950
Yes, I'm fine.

320
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,080
They're thugs so don't
mind them too much.

321
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
Yes.

322
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,300
You know, you were
really cool just now.

323
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,280
Let's hurry up.

324
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,520
We have lots to do today.

325
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,340
Ah, wait...

326
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,790
♫ The moment I went by the park ♫

327
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,720
♫ Sunshine and breeze both ♫

328
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:24,130
♫ became a scenery
taken from a movie ♫

329
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:33,050
♫ A warm OST quietly flows over ♫

330
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:40,400
♫ as you and I as main characters
are captured on the screen  ♫

331
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:51,680
♫ Courage is mustered only
through this imagination ♫

332
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:58,960
♫ as I long to return to you ♫

00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,490
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

499
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,700
Pyo Tae Jin! Pyo Tae Jin!

500
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,960
Dissolving the wrestling team
wouldn't be enough...

501
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,260
What is this?

502
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,790
Shim Sang Hoon is volunteering here.

503
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,070
Really?

504
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,270
Hey, is there anything to
throw away? Give it.

505
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,190
It's the quarterfinals match.

506
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,300
Dang Young High's Pyo Tae Jin vs.

507
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,720
Dae Han High's Hwang Jae Woo's
match will take place.

508
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,220
Hey, there's quite a crowd.

509
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,060
All these people are
cheering for Tae Jin?

510
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,530
No way.

511
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,850
Hey, it's starting.

512
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,300
Fighting!

513
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,830
You have to lower your body!

514
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,050
Take out your hand!

515
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,860
Fighting!

516
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,030
Yeah, fighting!

517
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,350
Pyo Tae Jin earned four points.

518
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,920
That bastard is happy.

519
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,980
Huh.

520
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,490
Wow, daebak.

521
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,170
Let's dissolve the wrestling team.

522
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,390
How will you do it?

523
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,740
He sacrificed himself to
save the wrestling team.

524
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,560
He can do that one more time, right?

525
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,340
We'll step on Pyo Tae Jin first

526
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,680
and call him later to frame him.

527
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,420
Wow, I'm so good at
creating scenarios.

528
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,200
What's with you?

529
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,000
Go and gather all the guys.

530
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,980
Wow. Pyo Tae Jin, fighting!

531
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,590
Wow, he's good.

532
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,120
Hey, he's good.

533
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,390
This is fun, huh?

534
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,930
- When is the final match?
- The final match?

535
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,060
Let's see.

536
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,860
You don't know, right? Just watch.

537
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,020
Oppa.

538
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,430
I want to go home.

539
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,070
That bastard.

540
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,040
Home...

541
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,030
Please take me home.

542
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,740
Hey, let's go.

543
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,410
Why? The final match is coming up.

544
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,080
Why? We have to watch Tae Jin win.

545
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,200
- Follow me.
- Why?

546
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,830
♫ I gotta sing to the dirty world ♫

547
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,430
♫ I gotta sing to the dirty world ♫

548
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,860
♫ I gotta sing to the dirty world ♫

549
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,320
♫ I gotta sing to the dirty world ♫

550
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,390
♫ I gotta sing to the dirty world ♫

551
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,900
Dang Young High's Pyo Tae Jin vs.

552
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,280
Duk Jin High's Kim Young Tak's
final match starts now.

553
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,070
Take your positions.

554
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,890
Legs up.

555
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,370
Stand up!

556
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,930
Ready!

557
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
Oppa, you did so great...

558
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,230
Ho Rim!

559
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,600
Pyo Tae Jin from Dang Young
High is the champion.

560
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,450
Congratulations!

561
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,600
Hey, Tae Jin!

562
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,180
Go to the director's office quickly.

563
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,880
Why?

564
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,000
What do you mean?
The association chair attended.

565
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,120
He wants to meet you.

566
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,650
Really?

567
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,900
I'll treat you to BBQ!

568
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,600
Excuse me.

569
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,600
You are Pyo Tae Jin sunbae's
girlfriend, right?

570
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,200
Who...

571
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,880
I'm his hoobae.

572
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,720
Ah, yes.

573
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,430
- Tae Jin sunbae asked me to bring you.
- What?

574
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,380
I think he prepared
something special for you.

575
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,430
I'm really envious.

576
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Where is it?

577
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,300
Follow me.

578
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,830
Hey.

579
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,830
Let's just go.

580
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,300
What?

581
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,870
No matter how much I think,

582
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,720
I don't think I can beat up a girl.

583
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,180
- I'm leaving.
- Hey.

584
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,550
Are you sure it's a special event?

585
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,700
Of course. Do you see that corner?

586
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,100
As those kids open up a path,

587
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,570
Tae Jin sunbae will
appear with a candle.

588
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,300
- Wow...
- You have to act really surprised, okay?

589
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,300
Yes.

590
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,600
- Let's go.
- Yes.

591
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,280
Hey, champion!

592
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,490
Captain!

593
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,550
What captain? I got kicked out.

594
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,850
What are you doing here?

595
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,170
I'm waiting for Ho Rim.

596
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,690
Oh, really?

597
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,960
What about you, captain?

598
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,350
Coming back from getting a
signature for my volunteer work.

599
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,270
Are you meeting her at this hour?

600
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,610
No.

601
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,590
The association chair
wanted to see me

602
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,870
so I'm a little late.

603
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,150
Oh, the association chair?

604
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,590
- Look at you.
- Come on.

605
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,300
Why? Is something wrong?

606
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,690
No, nothing.

607
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,840
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.

608
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,580
Good luck with tomorrow's team match!

609
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,520
Hey, Hyuk.

610
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,200
What's wrong?

611
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,590
This can't be.

612
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,250
What can't be?

613
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,960
Are you sure you're okay?

614
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,400
What?

615
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,000
- What do you mean?
- If you run away like this,

616
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,100
this will remain as a trauma forever.

617
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,000
You didn't do anything wrong
so why are you running away?

618
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,300
What do you want me to do then?

619
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,800
Look him in the eyes.

620
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,510
And get an apology.

621
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,400
- I don't want to.
- Hyun Sun.

622
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,300
I don't want it.

623
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,570
I said I don't want to, so stop it.

624
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,670
What about Kyu Soon?

625
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,680
Even for Kyu Soon,

626
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,810
you can't end it like this.

627
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,200
Let's go.

628
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,060
Let's go and you tell him

629
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,840
to apologize to Kyu Soon
and to you, too.

630
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,990
He should apologize and ask
for forgiveness for his wrongdoings.

631
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,410
Go tell him that clearly.

632
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,330
Oppa...

633
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,750
if you help me...

634
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,830
Okay.

635
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,020
Great!

636
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,710
Let's go!

637
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,970
What is this?

638
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,260
This bastard!

639
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,200
Who is this?

640
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,120
He's the champion!

641
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,810
The champion!

642
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,340
Hi!

643
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,100
Why?

644
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,050
Didn't you say you
wouldn't get involved?

645
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,700
But...

646
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,600
you really came alone
just because I said so?

647
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,390
You guys...

648
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,870
Man, you're lowering
your voice again.

649
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,180
What? I can't hear you, bastard!

650
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,700
No one will escape
from here tonight.

651
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,000
You're so cool.

652
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,500
You...

653
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,400
just need to...

654
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,100
get beat up like that, you bastard.

655
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,890
I am...

656
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,810
the champion who earned...

657
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,400
the presidential award.

658
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,070
Pyo Tae Jin.

659
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,680
Let's see how long
you can keep your cool.

660
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,300
What are you doing?

661
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,000
My hair, my hair...

662
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:08,290
This bastard...

663
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,210
You crazy bastard.
Want to die, huh?

664
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:55,600
♫ You were there in those times ♫

665
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,220
♫ We'll go through it together  ♫

666
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,700
♫ I can have a new dream of my life ♫

667
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,150
♫ for the first time, first time, yeah ♫

668
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:11,140
♫ I can't do this alone, come on ♫
