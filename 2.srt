8
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,750
Is something going on?

9
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,640
Why are you doing this
in front of everyone?

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,060
Could we talk later in private?

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,190
Soo Jung.

12
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,890
Do you want to tell me?

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,080
What did you do behind my back?

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,900
It's...

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,200
Hey, Sung Kyu!

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,280
Why are you doing this to a friend?

17
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,090
Are you okay?

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,300
You know...

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,640
Gang Hoon called me.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,930
Sung Kyu...

21
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm really sorry.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,790
Seriously.

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,090
Sending Hyun Sun or whatever to the
hospital should've been enough.

24
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,840
Why did you make things worse?

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,540
I'm sorry!

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,700
I won't do that anymore.

27
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,830
Look down if you don't want to die.

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,170
If we stop here,

29
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,850
it will look like we got scared

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,160
by some neighborhood thugs.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,540
Don't you think so?

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,310
Stupid idiots!

33
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,890
What?

34
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,440
Neighborhood thugs?

35
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,310
Let's warm up before
returning to school.

36
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,790
I'm really considerate.

37
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,400
I won't touch the girl.
I'll just get the thugs.

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,150
Why so picky?

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,970
Never mind.

40
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,540
Okay. I'll take care of it.

41
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,880
Oh, also...

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,430
I have one more condition.

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,770
What else?

44
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,890
Do you want to fight me
in front of everyone?

45
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,990
That's not possible, you bastard.

46
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,950
When you come back,
you'll be a 10th grader.

47
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,870
It's not that...

48
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,710
What is it?

49
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,700
I don't want to do this anymore.

50
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,500
Fine, stop if you don't want to.

51
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,800
But...

52
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,870
take care of it for sure.

53
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,300
Alright.

54
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,230
Hey, Shin Do Yoon and Joo Sung.

55
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,360
You clean up the crap...

56
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,420
you created.

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,740
But I'll give you homework...

58
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,630
I'll just kill all those pigs.

59
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,600
Let's do this right, okay?

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,970
Huh?

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Answer me!

62
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,650
Yes!

63
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,420
Sunbae, are you okay?

64
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,760
Dang, you're a talented punk.

65
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,070
How can you turn me
over that quickly?

66
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,340
Geez, c'mon. This is nothing.

67
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,630
Aigoo... you can talk.

68
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,480
- Pay attention.
- Attention!

69
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,810
Wrap it up and break
until dinnertime.

70
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,940
Thank you!

71
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,060
Hey!

72
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,880
Your fan is here again.

73
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,750
Tell her not to come so often.

74
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,710
Why do you keep coming around?

75
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,320
Don't you have school?

76
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,440
- Hey!
- Yes?

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,860
Be respectful! Respectful...

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,550
Yes.

79
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,080
Wait here for a moment.

80
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,880
How dare he be rude to such a
precious female fan like that?

81
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,790
The President's Cup is a
really important tournament...

82
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,570
I just want to focus on that.

83
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,560
I just want to cheer for you.

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,040
Cheering is good and all, but...

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,580
don't keep showing up like this.

86
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,680
Wh... why?

87
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,480
You're mean.

88
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,360
Why do you have
to talk like that?

89
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,420
What did I do wrong?

90
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,930
No, it's not that, but...

91
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,870
Jo Rim, you are a senior.

92
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,470
You should be studying...

93
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,920
And I'm really not
into older women.

94
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,810
Nevertheless you looked at it.

95
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,780
What?

96
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,670
The letter I wrote to you.

97
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,100
Since you know
my name and my age.

98
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,770
Ah, that...

99
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,610
Did I look at it?

100
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,890
I'll get going for now.

101
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,800
I'll be sure to come and cheer
for you at the President's Cup.

102
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,820
Fighting!

103
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,890
You little punk,
don't you have any money?

104
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,490
- Are you deaf?
- Do you want to die?

105
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,550
Oh yeah, that's good.

106
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,870
Wow, everyone is
going to do a double turn.

107
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,650
You mean a double take.

108
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,260
Right, Hyuk?

109
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,920
Yeah, better than what I thought.

110
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,710
Thanks.

111
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,460
I have to go to the hospital
today, so I'll take off first.

112
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,460
Go on your way, double turn.

113
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,030
Hey, that's a nice drawing.

114
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,270
How come you drew Kyu Soon?

115
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,350
Just because.

116
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,320
Hey, Beethoven.

117
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,820
Go and buy me strawberry milk.

118
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,710
Didn't you hear me?

119
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,230
- Are you deaf?
- You stupid punk.

120
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,710
Oops...

121
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,650
- Aigoo.
- My bad...

122
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,650
You can't even hear properly.

123
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,940
So why do you wear stuff like this?

124
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,420
Huh?

125
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,890
Stop.

126
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,890
What? What is he saying?

127
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,610
Talk straight.

128
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,580
We're going to continue.

129
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,660
Hey.

130
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,910
Hold him for a sec.

131
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,430
Come on, stand up.

132
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,770
Arf, arf.

133
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,200
Bark like this.

134
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
Bark, bark.

135
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,210
What are you doing?

136
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,060
What's going on?

137
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,650
Dong Min, what's
that on your hair?

138
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,140
Jong Il.

139
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,220
Could you help Dong Min wash up?

140
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,430
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,330
I'm sorry, Dong Min.

142
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,420
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,780
Her esophagus has healed.

144
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,010
Her gastric fluid secretion
has returned to normal.

145
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,690
She can be discharged.

146
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,580
She can receive
outpatient treatment.

147
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,070
Thank you.

148
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,270
The issue is the psychological
trauma the patient has received.

149
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,360
Treatment is important for this,

150
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,670
but the role of the family and
friends are the most important.

151
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,000
I understand.

152
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,560
There were only four of us.

153
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,480
But they brought
six orders of ramen.

154
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,000
I was about to tell the owner
that it wasn't our order, but...

155
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,610
You know Bon Hwan, right?

156
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,190
This guy.

157
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,600
The guy with weird hair.

158
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,770
He held my wrist and said,

159
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,890
"Hey, that's ours, man!"

160
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,940
He took three servings. Wow...

161
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,800
I've never seen
anyone eat so much.

162
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,210
He's a total glutton.

163
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,580
And...

164
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,070
this is Jae Wook.

165
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,930
Isn't he handsome?

166
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,060
And then this is Hyuk.

167
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,960
He's so cool.

168
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,960
We took so many pictures.

169
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,700
It's here.

170
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,300
Look at this.

171
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,540
Isn't this fun?

172
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,980
Yeah, it's fun.

173
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,790
No, it's not fun for you.

174
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm glad.

175
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,840
Huh?

176
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,130
Seems like you got good friends.

177
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,610
No, what I'm saying is that...

178
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,560
not me, but you...

179
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,190
I'm cold, Oppa.

180
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,180
I want to go inside.

181
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,650
Oppa, you go home, too.

182
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,930
Hyun Sun.

183
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,820
Huh?

184
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,720
We'll go home.

185
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,130
Doctor said,

186
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,930
you're fine now so
you can be discharged.

187
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,710
I'll stop by the admin office.

188
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,020
Let's go home now.

189
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,430
Okay?

190
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,800
Okay.

191
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,190
Hyuk, be careful.

192
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,110
Aren't you curious
to know who I am?

193
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,790
I'll ask you after
I'm done with you.

194
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,820
Since you're discharged,

195
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,440
let's go home and
eat something good.

196
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,380
I asked Dad...

197
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,410
and he says things will be
ready in a few weeks.

198
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,250
So we can prepare
to go to the States.

199
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,950
Kim Kyu Soon!

200
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,700
This is not a free study session
but a mandatory study session.

201
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,450
I know.

202
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,530
Hey, we're the only ones from
our grade who stay after school.

203
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,150
Hey,

204
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,580
should we skip out?

205
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,860
Should we?

206
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,940
There's so much to do.
What do you mean skip out?

207
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,610
Did you forget what
Gang Hoon sunbae said?

208
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,610
Whenever you get a chance,

209
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,700
to do what?

210
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,750
Pick on Beethoven.

211
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,680
Let's go.

212
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,900
Do you want to die?

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,850
Did you eat something wrong?

214
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,030
Hey.

215
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,700
Are you crazy? Huh?

216
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,100
Oppa!

217
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,220
Don't do that.

218
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,080
Don't do it?

219
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,670
You're being rude.

220
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,930
Do you want to die?

221
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,870
What the heck are you saying, stupid?

222
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,040
Hey!

223
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,070
Is that all you can say?

224
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,290
Think about your sister,
you're so selfish.

225
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,970
Sung Kyu is waiting.
Let's just go quietly.

226
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,270
Man, ruining my mood...

227
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,180
Hyuk!

228
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,720
Pretty good.

229
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,830
Are you giving me an evaluation?

230
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,670
What's the reason?

231
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,010
The guy who got ripped off
by you asked me to do it.

232
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,860
We've never taken anyone's money.

233
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,530
Bulls***.

234
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,710
You move and it'll break.

235
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,250
Good. Just break it.

236
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,250
What?

237
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,610
This hand is a shameful hand.

238
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,980
Just break it.

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,340
Hey, you saw that, right?

240
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,630
I won this time.

241
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,860
Man...

242
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,360
Here.

243
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,040
Who sent you?

244
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,200
Hey.

245
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,190
If you won't talk, buy us food.

246
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,250
You beat us up, then keep quiet?

247
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,460
What are you doing?

248
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,850
Hey, I was going to donate
this to the orphanage.

249
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,240
If I lose this...

250
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,180
You are so ungrate.

251
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,140
You mean ungrateful...

252
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,130
Why am I fine?

253
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,230
You're thugs.

254
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,770
If you're curious,
then buy us some food.

255
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,390
We're not the kind of
people you think we are.

256
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,860
Seems like it.

257
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,610
What were their names?

258
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,280
Kyu Son?

259
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,930
No, Kyu Soon.

260
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,320
- They took them.
- What?

261
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,840
- To where?
- As soon as you make a move to save them...

262
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,140
you're messing with the
Gi Cheon-Dang Young alliance.

263
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,340
Can you handle it?

264
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,910
If you're thinking of
fighting against Gi Cheon,

265
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,060
go and find Lee Dong Jae
from Hanchun High.

266
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,260
He's like an antenna around here.

267
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,870
Lee Dong Jae?

268
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,100
Plus, avoid Jo Gang Hoon from
Gi Cheon High as much as you can.

269
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,110
I gave you all the information.

270
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,800
The rest is up to you.

271
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,280
Hey! You have to tell us
where Kyu Soon is!

272
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,730
You act all cool.

273
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,390
You idiot.

274
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,500
Hey, Beethoven.

275
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,920
Look at this.

276
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,340
Please stop.

277
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,800
Please stop.

278
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,610
Hey, what is this bastard saying?

279
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,540
No matter how much I look at you
over and over and over again...

280
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,860
you're like a dog.

281
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,460
Look at this.

282
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,370
Please stop.

283
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,190
- Please stop.
- You want us to stop?

284
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,380
For free?

285
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,560
Hey, if you like free
things, you'll go bald.

286
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,200
So just bark and we'll let you go.

287
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,170
Woof, woof, woof...
Are you tired?

288
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,570
Huh?

289
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,830
Stop.

290
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,250
What are you doing?

291
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,820
Is this all you can think of?

292
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,100
Hey.

293
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,470
Did you just fight?

294
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,540
Yeah.

295
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,810
Go and tell Jo Gang Hoon.

296
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,890
Gang Hoon sunbae?

297
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,860
You bastard...

298
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,610
You think you're somebody, huh?

299
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,710
Come out.

300
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,040
I prepared this for you.

301
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,630
Okay?

302
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,150
Why?

303
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,800
Are you scared?

304
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,380
Is this really all you can do?

305
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,120
What are you saying?

306
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,680
I thought you weren't
going to get involved

307
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,950
in our business anymore.

308
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,970
The one who broke
the promise first

309
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,020
is you.

310
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,200
Alright.

311
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,270
I'll fight at your level.

312
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,030
Hello.

313
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,500
Woof!

314
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,550
Hey.

315
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,200
How many are gathered
here because of you?

316
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,290
You'll be popular.

317
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,430
Oppa. Oppa.

318
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,500
Oppa!

319
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,600
Oppa...

320
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,710
What is this?

321
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,860
Wow, daebak.

322
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,080
- Hey, Shin Soo Jung!
- Yes.

323
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,490
You did wrong.

324
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,500
Excuse me?

325
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,950
You should be jealous of someone
at your level, you know.

326
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,190
You have no shame.

327
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,400
Don't do anything to her.

328
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,080
Hello.

329
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,900
Hey.

330
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,690
Do you want to date me?

331
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Then your school life
will be so easy.

332
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,000
What should I do?

333
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,460
His sister says she's not interested.

334
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,110
Oppa!

335
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,880
Hey, you haven't had enough, huh?

336
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,890
- Oppa!
- Hyun Sun.

337
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,260
Please let us go.

338
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,290
Please save us.

339
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,650
I'm not saying I'll kill you.

340
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,660
I said let's date!

341
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,440
Please don't kill us.

342
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,560
- I'm fine, Hyun Sun.

Wow, that's Hyuk alright.

Okay.

that good at fighting?

Are you okay?

389

Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

No.

See you tomorrow.

I wish she would've called us oppa.

It looked like she couldn't
even hear us talk.

What oppa. Let's go.

He still has to buy us
sweet and sour pork.

That's why you have
to meet the right people.

Why do we have to
break the alliance?

- We rescued Kyu Soon.
- Because it's an alliance.

You're such a parasite.

- Of course, to find them!

00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,450
Because they are the police.

513
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,470
They have to have
all the options open.

514
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,270
Look at us.

515
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,420
We look like thugs.

516
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,360
Just accept it.

517
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,830
Anyway, let's go now.

518
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,090
Where?

519
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,120
We have to send off...

520
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,900
Kyu Soon.

521
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,490
You know where the funeral is?

522
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,790
Kyu Soon.

523
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,460
This is the first meal we're buying.

524
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,930
What the heck is this?

525
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,520
We should've gone sooner.

526
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,410
We're sorry.

527
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,560
My sister!

528
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,600
I want to protect my sister.

529
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,440
Brother-in-law, you don't have
to worry about anything now.

530
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,700
Why? Because I'll protect you.

531
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,700
This is Jae Wook Oppa.

532
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,620
Hello, Hyun Sun.

533
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,910
A gift for you.

534
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,870
Isn't he cool?

535
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,090
I'm so embarrassed.

536
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,830
She didn't even look
at me. Stop now.

537
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,490
Hand him over to us.

538
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,510
Do you sell out your friends?

539
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,000
Do you want to die?

540
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,900
Are you deaf?

541
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,040
Do you want to die, huh?

542
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,710
Oh, that's great.

543
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,750
Thanks.

544
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,620
You're not taking money from me.

545
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,210
But I'm treating my friends.

546
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,620
Okay.

547
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,990
Why did you draw Kyu Soon?

548
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,080
Just because.

549
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,100
[ Dang Young High School ]

550
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,950
[ 1227 days without violence in school ]
The police contacted us

551
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,720
saying they need to
do an investigation

552
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,550
regarding school violence.

553
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,950
Is it true that this
was school violence?

554
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,030
Of course not, Chairman Lee.

555
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,100
He died alone at home.

556
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,090
How can this be school violence?

557
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,090
He just had a short life.

558
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,310
That's it, right?

559
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:36,890
From my perspective,
this case is a little different.

560
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,670
On top of that, he was absent for
days without excuses, right?

561
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,710
Yes.

562
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,620
That is true, but...

563
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,750
He was a bad student
from the beginning.

564
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,280
You should've expelled him early on.

565
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,370
Homeroom teacher, what
kind of student was he?

566
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,550
Excuse me?

567
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,080
His grades were above average,

568
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,140
quiet, and diligent...

569
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,180
She's not asking you that right now.

570
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,400
I see...

571
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,780
I allowed him to go home
early twice recently.

572
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,290
He may have had
some sort of illness.

573
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,580
That's it.

574
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,590
But on the day of the incident,

575
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:24,360
his sister Kim Hyun Sun
was with him.

576
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,170
Don't you think we should
listen to her story first?

577
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,300
Let's be accurate here.

578
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,890
It's not an incident but an accident!

579
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,750
Also, Kim Hyun Sun was in the
hospital receiving mental treatment!

580
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,460
How can you believe
a mental patient?

581
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,180
Make sure to say the right
things with the police.

582
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,570
Let's not make this bigger over a kid
whose time ran out naturally.

583
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,540
It'll affect the academic
atmosphere negatively.

584
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,000
Also, make sure the parents
don't get swayed in this.

585
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,910
Send a letter to all the parents.

586
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,990
Yes.

587
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,100
Hey, do you think Hyun Sun is ok?

588
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,410
She probably can't even eat.

589
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,030
Hey, hurry. Come.

590
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,230
Hyun Sun!

591
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,500
Hyun Sun!

592
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,280
Let's see.

593
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,600
Hyun Sun!

594
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,080
Hyun Sun!

595
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,700
Hyun Sun!

596
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,300
Hyun Sun!

597
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,410
Hyun Sun...

598
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,430
What should we do?

599
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,700
Leave that here and go.

600
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,540
Hey, the box is still there.

601
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,580
Hyun Sun!

602
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,070
Kim Hyun Sun!

603
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,750
Hyun Sun!

604
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,620
Why don't you call her name?

605
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,800
Come.

606
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,100
Hyun Sun, we'll be back.

607
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,980
Hyun Sun!

608
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,570
Hyun Sun...

609
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,580
How can you eat that?

610
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,650
It expired already.

611
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,790
I think I can still eat it.

612
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,170
Just eat that.

613
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,450
Hyun Sun.

614
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:14,290
♫ You were there in those times ♫

615
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:21,370
♫ We'll go through it together  ♫

616
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:25,770

617

618
