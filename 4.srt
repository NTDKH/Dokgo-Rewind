00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,210
Hey, you fools.

172
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,720
Don't argue over stuff like that.

173
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,180
You met Jo Kang Hoon?

174
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,590
Yeah.

175
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,880
Did you lose?

176
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
I totally don't want to
make excuses, but

177
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,000
my hand was hurt earlier and

178
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,470
I didn't even get to use
one-eighth of my strength...

179
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,320
Yeah, so I lost.

180
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,470
Happy?

181
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,380
But what's up with your expression?

182
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,630
What is?

183
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,220
You're smiling since you came.

184
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,520
Me?

185
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,450
I'm not sure.

186
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,120
I got beat up, but
somehow I feel better.

187
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,900
Are you a pervert?

188
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,800
Dang.

189
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,180
I thought I'd feel good
beating up people, but

190
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,880
I felt better getting beat up.

191
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,780
If I had known, I'd have
come out of this sooner.

192
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,750
I guess Jo Kang Hoon is fairly strong.

193
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,350
If we want to break up the alliance,
we'll have to deal with Jo Kang Hoon.

194
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,080
What alliance?

195
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,000
It's a promise we made.

196
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,070
Aigoo. I know that.

197
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,600
How will you destroy them?

198
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,910
And why do you want to?

199
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,160
Huh? Hey.

200
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,010
Because they suspended you?

201
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,520
Aigoo.

202
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,600
You should stop.

203
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,000
- Revenge will reap...
- It's not revenge.

204
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,980
It's justice.

205
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,810
Man, what a show-off.

206
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,400
They bully kids and
take their money.

207
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,350
They share that money.

208
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,310
To get more money,
they bully more kids.

209
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,730
I couldn't do anything by myself.

210
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,150
So I promised with Hyuk.

211
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,540
We'll destroy them all.

212
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,200
And until we destroy Gi Cheon,

213
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,620
we haven't avenged Kyu Soon.

214
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,630
- Is there space?
- No.

215
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,810
Let me be in it, too.

216
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,210
You? Why?

217
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,650
Just because...

218
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,150
we're friends.

219
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,320
So...

220
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,100
then what should we do?

221
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,320
We have someone to talk to.

222
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,690
Hey, Dong Jae. It's me.

223
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,140
Gi Cheon High...

224
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,550
we'll attack them again.

225
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,130
You saw all the pictures, huh?

226
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,530
There are so many pretty girls.

227
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,120
Going to my acting classes
is so enjoyable.

228
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,100
Do you want me to
introduce you to one?

229
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,400
Dong Jae.

230
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,500
Huh?

231
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,000
Dong Jae, why did you
hang up earlier?

232
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,200
Oh, my battery ran out.

233
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,480
What did you say?

234
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,640
Let's destroy Gi Cheon High.

235
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,070
We're...

236
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,790
ready.

237
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,680
Okay. Listen carefully.

238
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,000
There will be an installation
ceremony this weekend.

239
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,930
How do you know this?

240
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,790
Geez, I'm the antenna around here.

241
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,940
Everyone comes to me asking
who's busting up Gi Cheon High.

242
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,440
I guess I was one of them.

243
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,690
Right.

244
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,530
Anyway, there will be an installation
ceremony this weekend

245
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,520
down at the Mansuk
warehouse at 6 p.m.

246
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,170
Do they normally have
ceremonies at a place like that?

247
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,850
I don't know. That's up to them.

248
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,350
And this the only chance you'll get
before the guys you beat up recover.

249
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,130
Thanks, Dong Jae.

250
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,590
- Send me the address.
- Okay.

251
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,300
Done.

252
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,160
I did everything you told me to do.

253
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,610
That's why I'm leaving it at this.

254
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,380
That son of a b****.

255
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,870
Hey, you're so close.
Why do you need to stab?

256
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,190
Even if he hangs on to you,

257
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,870
he's not winning.

258
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,520
That's so if he does a frontal attack.

259
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,090
Look carefully.

260
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,800
Like this, you go under

261
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,260
and when the opponent
is pushing you down

262
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,170
you take the shoulder
and back and...

263
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,400
Hey, feather.

264
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,120
Ow, ow.

265
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,540
Sorry.

266
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,420
Hey, Dong Jae.

267
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,380
Everything I said before is a lie.
I'm just being careful.

268
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,800
What are you talking about?

269
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,190
I was with Jo Kang Hoon.

270
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,060
He had questions regarding
his guys being attacked.

271
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,140
It's perfect timing.

272
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,160
Who holds an installation
ceremony at a place like that?

273
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,150
It's a set up to take you down.

274
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,740
That's even better.

275
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,800
We had to face them anyway,
and now they've set up the stage.

276
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,600
You're crazy, huh?

277
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,650
It's Jo Kang Hoon
we're talking about.

278
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,230
Even though you took down
some of the Gi Cheon thugs,

279
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,240
they still have many more
plus Jo Kang Hoon.

280
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,600
- You have no chance.
- Then, can you just...

281
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,290
lure Jo Kang Hoon?

282
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,100
Okay.

283
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,710
Let's do this.

284
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,850
Jo Kang Hoon is always
20 minutes late.

285
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,480
As if he were the main character.

286
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,290
He never takes the main
roads to hide his paths.

287
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,480
So for this event, too, he'll use
the side street by the junkyard.

288
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,940
- The side street by the junkyard?
- Yeah, I'm 100% sure.

289
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,110
He's pretending to be mysterious.

290
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,400
So you can hide by the junkyard

291
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,110
and attack when
Jo Kang Hoon appears.

292
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,180
What about the rest?

293
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,200
The rest of them will be
at the designated place.

294
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,190
Hyuk, that's not important.

295
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,770
No matter what, you have
to beat him up good.

296
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,430
Otherwise you've got no chance.

297
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,930
Got it.

298
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,540
And Dong Jae...

299
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,660
What?

300
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,160
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,310
Hey...

302
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,680
if you're sorry, call me hyung.

303
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,810
Dong Jae hyung...

304
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,730
I don't know if this is the
right thing to do. Dang it.

305
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,890
Let's do this.

306
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,500
I'll be at the junkyard.

307
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,360
You go and attack the
rest of the thugs.

308
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Jong Il will take on Myung Jin Hwan.

309
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,700
Will you be okay?

310
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
I'll get better by this weekend.

311
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,130
When my wrist heals,
everyone's dead.

312
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,660
I'll take care of Jo Kang Hoon.

313
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,850
As you wish.

314
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,970
Let's end the conversation here.

315
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,720
We have to start again.

316
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
Start what?

317
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,390
Are you going to relax
until the weekend?

318
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,890
Hyuk.

319
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,940
What?

320
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,240
Are you busy?

321
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,810
I have to go now.

322
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,460
Why? You've got something to say?

323
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,860
You know, it's our birthday today.

324
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,340
Mom will make your favorite bulgogi.

325
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,430
Not me. It must be your favorite.

326
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,630
I'll take care of myself,
so enjoy your birthday party.

327
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,960
Bye.

328
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,920
Sunbaenim.

329
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,320
We're all here.

330
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,730
Wait outside.

331
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
What the heck are we doing?

332
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,730
He always does whatever he wants.

333
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,090
Just do as told.

334
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,850
Kang Hoon says he'll
tell us everything later.

335
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,630
Yes, yes.

336
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,540
I got it.

337
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,700
Where's Tae Jin?

338
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,120
Forget about him.

339
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,560
What? Weren't you
coming together?

340
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,550
Hey, don't ask too much.

341
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,590
He's embarrassed and
said to keep it a secret.

342
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,500
Anyway, let's go ahead.

343
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,830
Why? It's better to go together.

344
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,690
If Jo Kang Hoon finds out while we're
dragging our feet, we have no chance.

345
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,990
We have to take them
down beforehand.

346
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,850
Hey, are you saying Hyuk will lose?

347
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,320
I'm saying you just never know.

348
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,490
Who knows, he might
take the main road.

349
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,800
Let's go. Tae Jin will
come on his own.

350
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,740
Sunbaenim!

351
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,460
Aigoo, Jong Il.

352
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,410
What brings you here?

353
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,240
Gi Cheon High's Jo Kang Hoon?

354
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,640
Who are you?

355
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,820
Dokgo.

356
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,710
Follow me.

357
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,710
What about here?

358
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,550
Good, right?

359
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,500
It's fine.

360
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,280
You're a decent fighter.

361
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,470
Everyone talked big about you,

362
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,540
Jo Kang Hoon,

363
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,540
so I was a bit nervous.

364
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,390
But there's nothing to it.

365
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,290
Bluffing, huh?

366
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,390
Bluffing.

367
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,170
With the dissolution of
this club on the line,

368
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,370
we came to challenge you.

369
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,160
Let's finish this today.

370
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,350
Well?

371
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,220
I thought you were done last time.

372
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,250
Don't you remember?

373
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,220
Aigoo, aigoo. You're full of crap.

374
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,900
There are too many little thugs.

375
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,300
Well, Tae Jin will be here soon.

376
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,340
Let's end it before Tae Jin arrives.

377
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,780
Yeah, we can make
him buy us dinner.

378
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,490
Get rid of them!

379
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,010
Before Kang Hoon arrives. Quickly.

380
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,800
You a**hole!

381
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,190
Now I get why he called everyone.

382
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,010
This is our chance to leave, too.

383
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,840
What is this?

384
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,680
Kang Hoon is late.

385
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,480
He's not answering.

386
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,210
That's good.

387
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,800
He'll give us s*** if he sees that.

388
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,560
Hey, don't come. Don't come.

389
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,960
Don't come!

390
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,290
Seriously!

391
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,240
I'm not late, right?

392
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,540
Hyungnim's here.

393
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,350
Dumba**.

394
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,920
What the heck is he?

395
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,200
Get him!

396
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,800
Why is it so loud?
You're not done yet?

397
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,120
Aigoo.

398
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,760
Feather.

399
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,150
Who's the one you talked about?

400
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,220
Okay.

401
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,300
Then, I'll take care of that one.

402
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,920
Are you the one who
beat up Sung Kyu?

403
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,010
I hate hearing that name.

404
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,940
A little precaution...

405
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,790
I'm nothing like Sung Kyu.

406
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,110
I'm Kim Young Ha, second in
command at Gi Cheon High.

407
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,290
Okay, I got it.

408
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,800
So let's hurry.

409
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,370
That bastard...

410
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,750
Shall we see how you've
changed since last time?

411
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,600
A**hole...

412
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,670
Come.

413
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,060
Hey, Kim Jong Il.

414
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,760
What changed in the meantime?

415
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,270
After he took one away,
my mind went blank.

416
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,540
Then how about just using one.

417
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,650
What?

418
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,830
Using one, you can go
directly, bam, bam, bam!

419
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,920
Let go of one?

420
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,500
You suck at fighting, huh?

421
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,250
You bastard!

422
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,460
Like this, you go under...

423
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,430
when the opponent
is pushing you down

424
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,000
you take the shoulder
and back and...

425
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,200
What took you so long?

426
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,920
What about Hyuk?

427
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,560
Did you call him?

428
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,210
He's not answering.
We should go and see.

429
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Thanks.

430
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,900
Go.

431
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,530
Hyuk.

432
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,860
You're Dokgo?

433
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,070
The legendary 1 against 30
from two years ago.

434
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,250
You should've told me. You
could've avoided all this.

435
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,910
But then, what is Dokgo?

436
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,480
An outsider?

437
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,440
A poisonous drum.

438
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,390
Anyone who hears its beat

439
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,390
dies.

440
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,850
I feel like throwing up.

441
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,940
Hey, you look so cool right now.

442
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,800
I brought him because
he might die.

443
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,140
Hurry up and take him.

444
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,320
Hey, should I spread the word?

445
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,780
If I spread the word,
you'll become a celebrity.

446
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,810
If you must...

447
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,880
say that Jong Il did it.

448
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,860
Today is his day.

449
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,230
Alright.

450
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,100
Geez.

451
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,840
Is he dead?

452
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,700
He's not breathing.

453
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,900
He's completely gone.

454
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,900
Thanks, Dong Jae.

455
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,170
You're still not
calling me hyung.

456
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,030
I'm a senior.

457
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,000
He's heavier than me.

458
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,720
Who raised him?

459
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,300
Hyuk.

460
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,450
Hyuk.

461
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,820
She wants to talk to you.

462
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,190
Who is it?

463
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,220
You don't know, huh?

464
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,420
- Hyun Sun.
- Hello, Oppa!

465
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,580
- Are you doing well?
- Yeah.

466
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,350
I've gotten used to things
and am doing fine.

467
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:37,330
Oppa, I have something to tell you.

468
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:39,140
To me?

469
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,380
What?

470
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,450
Happy birthday!

471
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,730
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

472
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,930
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

473
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,840
♫ Happy birthday dear Oppa,
happy birthday to you ♫

474
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,610
- Why? Why?
- I can't bring myself to do it.

475
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,970
Singing to another guy...

476
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,110
You're all the same.

477
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,920
Thank you, Hyun Sun.

478
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,030
I'll call you later.

479
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,730
Thank you.

480
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,630
How did you know that
today is my birthday?

481
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,870
Dang, you talk too much.

482
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,380
Hey, just enjoy your birthday.

483
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,900
Hey, you can't play with food!

484
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,000
Hey.

485
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,800
You're such a parasite!

486
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,900
This is really good.

487
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,000
Hold on a sec.

488
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,050
Hello.

489
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,450
Excuse me?

490
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,910
A detective at the
hospital said that

491
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,310
my twin brother who was
wearing Tae Sung High's uniform

492
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,430
was beaten to an inch of his life.

493
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:06,040
The school contacted my parents

494
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,840
and the cops

495
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,490
are investigating this crime.

496
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,370
[ 7 months later ]

497
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,070
Ultimately,

498
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,160
my brother Hoo passed away.

499
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,800
My dad who was rushing back
upon hearing the news

500
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,110
died getting hit by a car.

501
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,650
After losing her husband and son

502
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,900
at the same time,

503
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,960
my mother lost her
mind and left home.

504
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,700
